This repository was the result of testing an ESAKI diode.  If you don't know what these are, this data will not make much sense to you.  As a semiconductor-focused researcher to happens to interact heavily in the microwave research community, I just happened to be the ideal person to take this data.  The data file is in matlab, which I've long since moved away from to python; however, github also moved away from subversion I have not updated this.  The paper can be found here:
